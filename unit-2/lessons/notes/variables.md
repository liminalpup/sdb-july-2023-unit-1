# Variables

Variables are used to store and to point to things in memory.

Ex: Algebra

```js
x = 15

x + 5 = ? //20

```

In JS, all variables must have 'unique names'

### Rules for Naming
-Names can contain letters, numbers, underscores, and even dollar signs.
-Names MUST begin with a letter.
-Names can begin with a dollar sign as well as an underscore but it's not really used.
-Names are case sensitive (x and X are different)
-Reserve words CANNOT be used. (class, let, const, var)
